# Week-4-5 Diabetes Project

I did a project from a Kaggle dataset about a study of Pima Indian Women who had and didn't have diabetes. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can predict which women have diabetes and which don't. I gained a lot of insight on factors leading to diabetes, conditions not highly correlated to diabetes and of course more about machine learning. Enjoy and thank you for reading. -Walter
